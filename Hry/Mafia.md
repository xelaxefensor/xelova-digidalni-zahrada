Tinker Steps:Switch to older version: 5.0-10

The game kept running setup.exe instead of the normal game.

Here are the steps to fix it:

1. Set your Steam interface language to English.
2. Run setup.exe, configure your settings and save it.
3. Start the game (now it should run the accuall game).
4. Set your Steam interface language back to yours.
5. Go to the Steam library, right click on Mafia and then click > Properties > General > Language and choose any language you want.
6. Steam will download the correct language of the game and then it should work!
